# BinaryRipper

A Windows-based binary analysis tool designed to detect buffer overflow vulnerabilities through function hooking and runtime monitoring. BinaryRipper intercepts critical memory operations using a sophisticated thread pool hook implementation that works across both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

Key features:

Dynamic function interception with minimal performance overhead
Thread pool-based asynchronous monitoring system
Buffer overflow detection without requiring source code
File input validation for testing potentially vulnerable applications
Support for hooking Windows APIs to analyze their behavior

This tool is primarily intended for security researchers, penetration testers, and developers looking to identify memory corruption vulnerabilities in Windows applications. BinaryRipper aims to provide detailed crash information that can be further analyzed with tools like IDA Pro.
